# Student Re-Enrollment Using Random Forest Algorithm

## Project Description
This system is developed to predict the re-enrollment of prospective students at Universitas Selamat Sri Batang using the Random Forest algorithm. The model helps university administrators identify students who are at risk of not completing their re-enrollment process.

## Goals
- Develop a classification model to predict student re-enrollment.
- Analyze the factors influencing student re-enrollment.

## Teknologi yang Digunakan
- **Python**: The primary programming language.
- **Flask**: A web framework for displaying prediction results.
- **Random Forest**: The main algorithm for classification.
- **SMOTE**: To handle data imbalance.
- **Chi-Square**: For feature selection.
- **Scikit-learn**: For machine learning implementation.
- **Pandas & NumPy**: For data manipulation.

## Fitur Utama
- **Re-Enrollment Prediction:** The model can predict whether a prospective student will complete re-enrollment..
- **Preprocessing Data**: Cleaning and transforming data before modeling.
- **Data Balancing**: Using SMOTE to address data imbalance.
- **Feature Selection:** Using Chi-Square to select the most influential features.
- **Model Evaluation:** Utilizing confusion matrix, accuracy, precision, and recall.

## Dataset
The dataset consists of admission records of prospective students at Universitas Selamat Sri Batang from the 2020 to 2023 academic years, totaling 1,358 records, with 12 attributes and 1 target class.

## Evaluasi Model
- **Model Accuracy:** 93.76% after balancing with SMOTE and feature selection using Chi-Square.
- **Confusion Matrix:** Used to assess model predictions.
- **Evaluation Metrics:** Precision, Recall, and F1-Score.
